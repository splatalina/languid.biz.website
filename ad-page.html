Thank you for clicking our ad for the special offer which is: the truth in our hearts we want everyone to hear: Crider believes that a canned ground meat withOUT juices fucking sucks and we don't need that--we need juices, so badly that it actually hurts more than you could ever know. Juices are what makes life worth living and what makes a dinner yummy and easy because the juices are right in the can with the meat when you open it to eat. As much as we are invested in locking up ground meat with their very own juices into cans that protect and encase the meat and juices so securely, you might think we aren't as excited for when you pierce our can to open it and let the meat and juices out but these rumors end here and now: we may not be with you or looking at you when you get into the cans but we are proud of you and we wish we could see it or even enjoy eating the Crider products with you.
