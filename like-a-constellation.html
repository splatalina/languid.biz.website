		<h1 style="color:white;">To the Fig Tree on 9th and Christian</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">By Ross Gay</p>
    
<p style="color:white;">Tumbling through the<br>
city in my<br>
mind without once<br>
looking up<br>
the racket in<br>
the lugwork probably<br>
rehearsing some<br>
stupid thing I<br>
said or did<br>
some crime or<br>
other the city they<br>
say is a lonely<br>
place until yes<br>
the sound of sweeping<br>
and a woman<br>
yes with a<br>
broom beneath<br>
which you are now<br>
too the canopy<br>
of a fig its<br>
arms pulling the<br>
September sun to it<br>
and she<br>
has a hose too<br>
and so works hard<br>
rinsing and scrubbing<br>
the walk<br>
lest some poor sod<br>
slip on the<br>
silk of a fig<br>
and break his hip<br>
and not probably<br>
reach over to gobble up<br>
the perpetrator<br>
the light catches<br>
the veins in her hands<br>
when I ask about<br>
the tree they<br>
flutter in the air and<br>
she says take<br>
as much as<br>
you can<br>
help me<br>
so I load my<br>
pockets and mouth<br>
and she points<br>
to the step-ladder against<br>
the wall to<br>
mean more but<br>
I was without a<br>
sack so my meager<br>
plunder would have to<br>
suffice and an old woman<br>
whom gravity<br>
was pulling into<br>
the earth loosed one<br>
from a low slung<br>
branch and its eye<br>
wept like hers<br>
which she dabbed<br>
with a kerchief as she<br>
cleaved the fig with<br>
what remained of her<br>
teeth and soon there were<br>
eight or nine<br>
people gathered beneath<br>
the tree looking into<br>
it like a<br>
constellation pointing<br>
do you see it<br>
and I am tall and so<br>
good for these things<br>
and a bald man even<br>
told me so<br>
when I grabbed three<br>
or four for<br>
him reaching into the<br>
giddy throngs of<br>
yellow-jackets sugar<br>
stoned which he only<br>
pointed to smiling and<br>
rubbing his stomach<br>
I mean he was really rubbing his stomach<br>
like there was a baby<br>
in there<br>
it was hot his<br>
head shone while he<br>
offered recipes to the<br>
group using words which<br>
I couldn’t understand and besides<br>
I was a little<br>
tipsy on the dance<br>
of the velvety heart rolling<br>
in my mouth<br>
pulling me down and<br>
down into the<br>
oldest countries of my<br>
body where I ate my first fig<br>
from the hand of a man who escaped his country<br>
by swimming through the night<br>
and maybe<br>
never said more than<br>
five words to me<br>
at once but gave me<br>
figs and a man on his way<br>
to work hops twice<br>
to reach at last his<br>
fig which he smiles at and calls<br>
baby, c’mere baby,<br>
he says and blows a kiss<br>
to the tree which everyone knows<br>
cannot grow this far north<br>
being Mediterranean<br>
and favoring the rocky, sun-baked soils<br>
of Jordan and Sicily<br>
but no one told the fig tree<br>
or the immigrants<br>
there is a way<br>
the fig tree grows<br>
in groves it wants,<br>
it seems, to hold us,<br>
yes I am anthropomorphizing<br>
goddammit I have twice<br>
in the last thirty seconds<br>
rubbed my sweaty<br>
forearm into someone else’s<br>
sweaty shoulder<br>
gleeful eating out of each other’s hands<br>
on Christian St.<br>
in Philadelphia a city like most<br>
which has murdered its own<br>
people<br>
this is true<br>
we are feeding each other<br>
from a tree<br>
at the corner of Christian and 9th<br>
strangers maybe<br>
never again.</p>
