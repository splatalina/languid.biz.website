		<h1 style="color:white;">4 sept 2017, Post-porpoise</h1>

	<p style="color:white;">After the porpoise was gone, the afterward nothingness would have been in itself enough to wilt anything, but there was not only nothingness. Pain objects began manifesting in the space. The light refracted off their surfaces; the pain objects translated the light into different light. There is nothing quite like a porpoise. In the water it sits unnaturally and unbeautifully, and the water becomes changed around it. It pushes the water with its whole body. Its eyes and its skin. Imagine the nothingness of the porpoise gone and how it would have been enough to wilt anyone, as we explained. </p> 

<p style="color:white;">And then we can speak more about the pain objects. This is how it came to be that in 1993 two small Beanie Babies lived quietly together in one fish bowl. The very short fibers along their whole bodies stood like inhabitants of a soft and misshapen globe. They swayed like algae while the center of their gravity held. Then the light behind the Beanie Babies got tangled in the fibers like a halo. They were beautiful. You would cry if you could see.</p>
