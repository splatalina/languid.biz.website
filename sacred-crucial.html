<p>in the sacred and crucial moment of breaking all i could think of was two gourds rolling around</p>

<p>hard to wake up<br>
8 unpaid hours unturning the earth to produce answers (dog-eared half memory)<br>
(three people swear to me that it was digging cured their or their loved one’s depression, the therapy of it isn’t completely lost on me---The sun turns a miasma into a kernel of sweat<br>
The night contains 6 iterations of itself, mud too wet, less moisture next time)</p>

<p>hypothesis one is some time ago you dedicated a part of your soul and vital energies to preparing in some small ways to be on reality tv and now that energy is gone from you</p>

<p>meanwhile the space by the door is the same space. it stays the same size from whatever distance.</p>

<p>a thought experiment: you are a loon who nests every year on little loon island. the traffic from a new camping resort will drive you away from this nesting site.</p>

<p>the conditions are perfect for<br>
the whole room moves away, the moon, and the air stills and the unmoving condors<br>
the nesting site stays the same size.<br>
what do hands do.</p>

<p>in a youtube video with a green background, black italic letters appear one by one until they spell más que todas las canciones que le he dedicado esta va con amor dolor y esperanza</p> 

<p>And in the moment of breaking all i can imagine is a small figure of spongebob squarepants hidden halfway in tall carpet fibers</p>

<p>Once, they told me it was my dirty carpet in the film.<br>
I woke <br>
i took a picture of the keys on the floor.<br>
and i moved them downstairs to the kitchen table <br>
now<br>
(they are so far and i am doing numbers on myself with them still)</p>
    
<p>a gourd has entered my life somewhere, escaping my vigilance</p>

<p>what hands? hypothesis 9:<br>
the survey they sent your home from the facility asked<br>
do you feel that you should not have dug up the bitter core<br>
or do you feel powerful and true when you hurt<br>
or do you feel both all the time the condor unmoving and the shaking mountain and <br>
600,000 people making letters appear one by one to make new proper noun names of products where the word didn’t exist before</p>

<p>Do you want beautiful tomatoes<br>
my little wet heart burning through a napkin and humming<br>
i tiptoe into the bathroom dark to discover a tube of bluegreen hair gel belonging to my brother and slip it into a velvet pouch that i take and no one sees small like an oriole</p>

<p>I move again  through the mango yellow lights that kill me but without blood<br>
(again this thick beauty, drowsy desperate and childlike tearstained sex again to pat the earth smooth once more---how can there be anything but love? And yet)</p>

<p>Words disappear like on a raft<br>
The cochayuyo</p>

<p>You dream of someone placing a beautiful little goat upon the shoulders of the pope, don't you?<br>
and loons nesting again on little loon island<br>
and amor dolor y esperanza</p>

<p>Not awake but now awake to the moon with the thin blue fabric with the dark impossible florals like a myth garden or a constellation or a prehistoric myspace gif</p>

<p>hypothesis 10 is different,<br>
noise and fear and leaving protrude beyond out outside the encapsulation of thought and outside the encapsulation of experiment</p>

<p>you’re digging now to something new  and the pieces always come back for better and worse and we dig and rotate and all of us always in it all in the newness in the soil nesting like that</p>
