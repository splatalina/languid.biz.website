The world contains many mysteries, few as generative of powerful theoretical advancement as the analysis of class and swag. We notice in our studies certain phenomena, how class and swag may push away from each other in certain individuals, one eclipsing the other partially or completely, while in rarer cases the two seem to harmonize, each exalted in their gravitational power equally (the elderly seem more likely than the young to hold both in equal measure). </p>
